# QuadTreeAlgorithm

This QuadTree implementation is based on the one into the following GitHub repo: https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/tree/master/CodingChallenges/CC_098.1_QuadTree/P5

This algorithm has been extendend in order to avoid more than N points into the same rectangle, like the original version.
